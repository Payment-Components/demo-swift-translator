# SWIFT Message Translator Demo

The project is here to demonstrate how our [SDK](https://www.paymentcomponents.com/messaging-libraries/) for 
SWIFT Message Translator works. For our demonstration we are going to use the demo SDK which can convert SWIFT MT to SWIFT MX (ISO20022) messages. 

It's a simple maven project, you can download it and run it, with Java 1.8 or above.
